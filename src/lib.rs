//! An implementation of a `k`-way merge iterator using a binary heap.
//! The `k`-way merge iterator is very useful when given `k` sets
//! of sorted data, you want to find the `n` top elements in between
//! the sets in an efficient way, without sorting the entire data set.
//!
//! Imagine having dozens of slices with hundreds of elements, where
//! you only care about the top 10.
//!
//! ```
//! use tournament_kway::Tournament;
//!
//! let t = Tournament::from_iters_min([(1..2000), (1..20000), (1..5000000)]);
//! assert_eq!(t.take(5).collect::<Vec<_>>(), [1, 1, 1, 2, 2]);
//!
//! ```
